##

<p align=center>You are given 3 different programs that each use all three sorting algorithms but you donâ€™t know which algorithm each program uses.

<p align=center>You are also given different text files that contain different-sized lists of sorted, reversed, and random numbers.

<p align=center>Your task is to determine which algorithm each program uses by using the time command in your codespace that tells you exactly how long it took the computer to complete the algorithm and explain why you think so.

<p align=center>You may submit this in a Google document file in the classroom.
