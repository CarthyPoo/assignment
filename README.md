<p align=center>Computer Science - Lawrence Porquia - Assignment #001: Introduction to sorting algorithms
  
##

<p align=center>You are given 3 different programs that each use all three sorting algorithms but you don’t know which algorithm each program uses.

<p align=center>You are also given different text files that contain different-sized lists of sorted, reversed, and random numbers.

<p align=center>Your task is to determine which algorithm each program uses by using the time command in your codespace that tells you exactly how long it took the computer to complete the algorithm and explain why you think so.

<p align=center>You may submit this in a Google document file in the classroom.

##

<p align=center>In today's class we will be doing some hands-on coding in C. you guys have regularly been coding in Python but today we are going to do things a bit differently.

<p align=center> Your task is to first create a program that can print "Hello, World" in C

IMPORTANT: In codespaces, you may encounter an error in which when you try to run the programs it will tell you "Permission Denied" and you must run chmod +x "program name" to allow yourself to execute the file as a program. (I.E. "chmod +x sort1")
